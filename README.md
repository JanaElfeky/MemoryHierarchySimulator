# MemoryHierarchySimulator
This project was worked on by a team of 3: Jana Elfeky, Andrew Antoine, and Abdelrahman Ihab.
The implemented caching system simulator is designed to mimic a one-level direct-mapped cache with support for both read and write operations. It simulates two write policies: write-through and write back. The simulator reads memory access sequences from an input file, processes each access, updates the cache state accordingly, and outputs detailed statistics on cache performance.
